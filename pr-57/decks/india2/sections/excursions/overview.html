    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>Kumarakom is one of the original pilot destinations for Kerala’s Responsible Tourism initiative, a model designed to benefit locals economically, socially, and environmentally rather than just entertain visitors. It has been recognized with national and international awards for innovation and community impact.</p>

      <h2>Responsible Tourism in Kerala</h2>
      <p>Kerala’s Responsible Tourism (RT) program is a state-led initiative that connects visitors with community-based experiences, ensuring tourism revenue supports local livelihoods while protecting cultural and environmental heritage. Kumarakom is a flagship RT destination with community-run excursions and locally guided experiences.</p>

      <h2>Kumarakom Responsible Tourism experiences</h2>
      <h3>Village Life Experience</h3>
      <p>This half-day package is crafted to show real village life: a canoe (vallom) or canal boat ride, watching and trying traditional activities like fishing and craftwork, strolling paddy fields, and engaging with locals in their everyday work. It’s about seeing and doing, not just observing.</p>
      <h3>A Day with Farmers</h3>
      <p>A full-day option that goes deeper into agricultural and rural rhythms: climbing coconut trees, toddy tapping, coir making, net fishing, farm visits, paddy field walks, traditional craft demonstrations, and canal cruising — all led by local hosts.</p>
      <p>These experiences typically start late morning and run for a few hours up to most of a day, with exact timings and meeting points (often around Kavanattinkara/Naalupang near the backwaters) confirmed when you book directly with the RT desk or a licensed operator.</p>
      <h3>Booking &amp; practical notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can book through the <strong>Responsible Tourism travel desk in Kumarakom</strong> (details listed above) or via licensed local operators who list the official RT packages.</li>
        <li>Confirm start time, meeting location, cancellation/refund terms, and safety details (like life vests for boat trips) before you commit.</li>
        <li>Booking through the RT mission or RT-listed operators helps ensure that a larger share of your money goes directly to the community and that the experience aligns with Responsible Tourism standards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Kerala’s RT model here is not just a tour — it’s a collaboration with villagers and self-help groups that turns your visit into a source of livelihood, pride, and cultural preservation.</p>
      <h2>Thaipooyam Festival</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.cholantours.com/blog/thaipooyam-mahotsavam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thaipooyam Mahotsavam</a>, also known as Thaipooyam/Thaipusam, is a devotional Murugan festival marked by kavadi processions, music, and ritual offerings in Kerala temple towns. The annual observances are detailed in festival overviews from <a href="https://www.indianpanorama.in/festivals/thaipooyam.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Panorama</a> and community notes such as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sri.eswaran.5/posts/thaipusam-2026-date-importance-puja-story-information-on-thai-poosamthaipoosam-i/26014986188137664/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Eswaran update</a>.</p>
      <p>For this trip window, Thaipooyam is scheduled for <strong>Feb 1, 2026</strong> in <strong>Haripad (Harippad), Kerala</strong>.

      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munnar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Munnar</a> (tea hills):</strong> Long drive into steep Western Ghats.

      <h2>Practical travel notes for February</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Peak travel season:</strong> February is typically one of the best months to visit Kerala — pleasant and mostly dry, great for backwaters and hills alike.</li>
        <li><strong>Ghats caution:</strong> Hill roads toward Munnar and Vagamon are twisty and can get slow with traffic or occasional maintenance work — local advice at your hotel or with your driver each morning is wise before you depart.</li>
      </ul>
