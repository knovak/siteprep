      <h1>Tiger excursions</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>Bandhavgarh, Kanha, and Panna are three of Central India's best tiger reserves. February is a strong wildlife month with dry conditions, mild days, and cooler mornings that make safari drives comfortable and visibility good.</p>
      <div class="meta-row">
        <div class="meta-box"><strong>Peak viewing:</strong> Early morning (sunrise) safaris</div>
        <div class="meta-box"><strong>February feel:</strong> Cool dawns, sunny afternoons, low humidity</div>
        <div class="meta-box"><strong>Typical clothing:</strong> Layers for 6–10°C mornings, light jacket by noon</div>
      </div>
      <h2>Park comparisons</h2>
      <h3>Bandhavgarh National Park</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> High tiger density, frequent sightings of sambar deer, chital, and langur monkeys.</li>
        <li><strong>February conditions:</strong> Dry grass and open sal forests aid visibility; mornings are brisk.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly-in access:</strong> Jabalpur (JLR) is the most common gateway, then 4–5 hours by road to Tala or Magadhi zones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Kanha National Park</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Tigers, leopards, and the rare barasingha (hard-ground swamp deer) across meadows and sal forests.</li>
        <li><strong>February conditions:</strong> Pleasant daytime temperatures with crisp dawns; excellent for full-day safari loops.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly-in access:</strong> Jabalpur (JLR) or Raipur (RPR), then 3.5–5 hours by road to the Kisli, Mukki, or Sarhi gates.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Panna National Park</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Tigers, leopards, gharial, and abundant birdlife along the Ken River and rocky plateaus.</li>
        <li><strong>February conditions:</strong> Dry riverbanks make boat-safari add-ons popular; mornings are cool but manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly-in access:</strong> Khajuraho Airport (HJR) is the nearest domestic air hub (45 minutes). Jabalpur Airport has more flights but is a 4–5 hour drive.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Panna Options</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eriline Resorts</strong> sits right opposite the <strong>Madla Gate</strong> of Panna Tiger Reserve, making it a natural fallback if you haven’t secured a permit in advance. Guests often work with the front desk to <em>monitor last-minute cancellations or tatkal windows</em>, and staff can assist with jeep/guide pickup right at the gate. The resort itself is known for comfortable rooms, natural surroundings, and local hospitality. (<a href="https://erilineresort.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">erilineresort.com</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Nature&apos;s Lap Resort</strong> is nestled in greenery about a km from Madla Gate. It’s quieter and scenic, with friendly staff who can help with safari logistics — including <em>keeping an eye on MPOnline openings and cancellations</em>. Its proximity still gets you close to safari zones and makes it easier to chase tatkal openings on the fly. (<a href="https://www.makemytrip.com/hotels/natures_lap_resort-details-panna.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">MakeMyTrip</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Ken River Lodge</strong> is a longer-established eco-stylistic lodge set on the <strong>Ken River</strong> itself. Beyond accommodation, it often <em>coordinates guided safaris, nature walks, and local boating</em>, which can be a strong fallback if you can’t lock in a permit or want something extra (like river boating or Raneh Falls trips). Travelers also find its riverside dining and jungle vibe worth the stay. (<a href="https://www.kenriverlodge.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Ken River Lodge</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Planning tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safari strategy:</strong> Book both morning and afternoon drives for at least two days to maximize sightings.</li>
        <li><strong>Permits:</strong> February is busy—reserve jeep and guide slots well in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Expect early departures (often before 6:00 AM) and slow drives on forest roads.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Park reservations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ranthambore zones:</strong> The reserve is segmented into Zones 1–10, with Zones 1–5 prized for sightings and often booked first. Booking works on randomized zone assignment: choose date and shift, then a zone is allocated.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle compliance:</strong> Gypsies and canters are expected to install front- and rear-facing dashcams within about a month or be barred from entering, to deter violations like crowding tigers or straying off routes. GPS tracking remains in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Permit timing:</strong> Most permits open 90 days in advance. A Tatkal quota appears about 7 days before the safari date (premium fee), and a current quota opens roughly a day before (around 10:00 AM).</li>
        <li><strong>Zone odds:</strong> No zone guarantees a tiger, but Zones 2–3 (and sometimes 4) are frequently cited as strong January options.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal closures:</strong> Reserves enforce seasonal and weekly closures, so confirm dates on the official Rajasthan Forest Department portal before finalizing travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Lodge bookings:</strong> Higher-end lodges may include or pre-reserve safari vehicles; confirm whether it is a guaranteed full-vehicle allotment or booking assistance with MPOnline.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Comparing safari vehicles</h2>
      <h3>Gypsy (gold standard)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dominant vehicle</strong> in Ranthambore, Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Panna, and Pench.</li>
        <li>Favored by <strong>photographers and repeat safari travelers</strong>.</li>
        <li>Small size helps drivers <strong>maneuver quickly</strong> and reposition at sightings.</li>
        <li>Downside: exposure to dust, sun, and cold mornings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If your priority is seeing wildlife well, choose a Gypsy whenever available.</p>
      <h3>Jeep (modern alternative)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increasingly common where Gypsies are aging out.</li>
        <li>Slightly more comfortable suspension and seats.</li>
        <li>Marginally larger, but still effective for sightings.</li>
        <li>Performance depends heavily on park rules and vehicle model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> A solid second choice, especially for mixed comfort + wildlife goals.</p>
      <h3>Canter (mass tourism option)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Used heavily in Ranthambore, occasionally elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Access is often limited to bus corridors.</li>
        <li>Sightings happen, but you are one of many observers.</li>
        <li>Guides have less flexibility; repositioning is slow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Acceptable if budget-constrained or permits are scarce, but inferior for wildlife experience.</p>
