      <h1>Tiger excursions</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>Bandhavgarh, Kanha, and Panna are three of Central India's best tiger reserves. February is a strong wildlife month with dry conditions, mild days, and cooler mornings that make safari drives comfortable and visibility good.</p>
      <div class="meta-row">
        <div class="meta-box"><strong>Peak viewing:</strong> Early morning (sunrise) safaris</div>
        <div class="meta-box"><strong>February feel:</strong> Cool dawns, sunny afternoons, low humidity</div>
        <div class="meta-box"><strong>Typical clothing:</strong> Layers for 6–10°C mornings, light jacket by noon</div>
      </div>
      <h2>Park comparisons</h2>
      <h3>Bandhavgarh National Park</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> High tiger density, frequent sightings of sambar deer, chital, and langur monkeys.</li>
        <li><strong>February conditions:</strong> Dry grass and open sal forests aid visibility; mornings are brisk.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly-in access:</strong> Jabalpur (JLR) is the most common gateway, then 4–5 hours by road to Tala or Magadhi zones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Kanha National Park</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Tigers, leopards, and the rare barasingha (hard-ground swamp deer) across meadows and sal forests.</li>
        <li><strong>February conditions:</strong> Pleasant daytime temperatures with crisp dawns; excellent for full-day safari loops.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly-in access:</strong> Jabalpur (JLR) or Raipur (RPR), then 3.5–5 hours by road to the Kisli, Mukki, or Sarhi gates.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Panna National Park</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Tigers, leopards, gharial, and abundant birdlife along the Ken River and rocky plateaus.</li>
        <li><strong>February conditions:</strong> Dry riverbanks make boat-safari add-ons popular; mornings are cool but manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly-in access:</strong> Khajuraho (HJR) is closest (45–60 minutes by road). Jabalpur is a longer but reliable alternative.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Planning tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safari strategy:</strong> Book both morning and afternoon drives for at least two days to maximize sightings.</li>
        <li><strong>Permits:</strong> February is busy—reserve jeep and guide slots well in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Expect early departures (often before 6:00 AM) and slow drives on forest roads.</li>
      </ul>
