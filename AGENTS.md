# AGENTS Instructions

## Technical documentation (techdoc)
You will find technical documentation ("techdoc") in the markdown files in this repo, in the root folder or under `shared`. Whenever you add code to the repo, be sure to update the techdoc, either by adding a markdown file or by expanding an existing markdown file.

## Content organization
You will often be asked by the user to add content. Content is located in a deck or a section, as described in the techdoc.

Content is generally organized as a web page that contains a series of "topics". Each topic has a title followed by a body. The body can combine any of the following elements:
- a block of text or a bulleted list
- an embedded display, such as a Google Maps embed
- a map, generated by the Leaflet package as described in techdoc 
- a distance visualization, as described in techdoc
- a photo gallery, as described in techdoc

## Highlights
Content may be requested to be "highlighted" or "placed in a highlight". This means you should use the `.highlight` in the CSS to make a highlight box as described in techdoc.

## URLs
Content may be supplied as text with URLs. Always include every URL in the resulting content, generally as a link from some text in the content.

## Merged list items
A content request may ask for items to be merged in a list. Always examine the combined list and combine the information from duplicate entries into a single entry.

## Locations
Requested content may request a location to be provided. For a location, look it up online. In the content, always supply the name of the location, a brief summary of it if available, a street address, and a link to a Google Map of the location. If the location is in a country that uses a non-Roman script like Kanji or Tamil, provide the street address in both English and the non-Roman script. If the location has operating hours (like a store or restaurant), provide the hours in a concise format like "M-F 10-5, Sa 12-4".

## Photo galleries
A photo gallery may be requested with a list of URLs, each of which has an image file, or with a file prefix. A prefix indicates that you should find the photos in the deck's `assets/images` folder and add any files in that folder where the file name begins with the prefix, and add the URLs for those files to the gallery.

## Distance visualizations
A distance visualization may be requested with a list of location pairs, each pair with a time, such as "Fort Kochi to Alleppey houseboat 1h50m". You should find the locations' latitude and longitude to supply to the distance visualizer.

## Map generation
A request for making a "standard map" or simply a "map" should use the recommendations in LEAFLET_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md.  This includes
* creating two displays, one OpenStreetMap followed by OpenTopoMap 
* use Custom Colored Markers
* provide a clickable legend at the bottom of each display

## minimize merge conflicts
When adding content, do not modify README.me unless a new deck is added.
